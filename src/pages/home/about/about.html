        <div class="main-description" style="max-width: 690px;">
            Aquarius is designed to supercharge trading on Stellar, bring more liquidity and give control over how it is distributed
            across various market pairs. It adds incentives for SDEX traders ("market maker rewards") and rewards for AMM liquidity providers.
            Aquarius allows community to set rewards for selected markets through on-chain voting.
